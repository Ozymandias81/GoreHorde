In the invasion on Earth, the military saw combat in several different toxic waste areas,
where radiation and toxins were lethal to marines, but didn't seem to even phase the
demons. Working to combat this advantage, the UAC developed the biosuit. Meant for combat
in nuclear or biological waste, the biosuit offers much more protection than the standard
radiation-shielding suits used for routine maitenance.


=====Modder notes:
PLEASE modify the PowerProtection actor to protect against any poison-ish damage in your
mod. Easily done by adding a DamageType to the projectile or whatever and adding a
DamageFactor entry to the PowerProtection actor itself.
