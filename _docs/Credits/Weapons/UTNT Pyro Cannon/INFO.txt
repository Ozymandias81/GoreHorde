Name: Pyro-Cannon
Class: 7
Type: Projectile
Palette: Custom
Summon: UTNTPyroCannon
Ammo Type: Gas (Custom)
Altfire: No
Powered Mode: No
Added States: No

Modder Notes: Uses the same ammo type and pickups, the DropFire actor, and some sprites
from the UTNT Flamethrower.

This version differs from the one in UTNT and Stronghold a bit. I evened out the
amount of damage this does (originally, the projectile itself, without explosion
damage, did 180-1440 damage).
