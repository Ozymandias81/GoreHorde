Description             : A huge resource (1700+) of new, recolored or 
			  redefined textures and flats basically for
			  Heretic but some might also work in other
			  games. Definied between TX_ markers and a
			  ANIMDEFS file included so you can just start
			  with your custom spiced up Heretic map.
