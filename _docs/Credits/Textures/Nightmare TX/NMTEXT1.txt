Title                   : NiGHTMARE texture WAD 1 version 1.01

Filename                : NMTEXT1.WAD

Description		: 150+ of my best textures.  All of the ones
			  contained here are being used in various
			  projects, though most of them were taken
			  from Paradox.

			  There's no specific theme; the WAD contains
			  everything from brick, rock and wood to
			  metal and techbase.

			  Texture WAD 2 will probably contain only
			  new animated textures (lava fall, water fall,
			  etc).

Update			: I forgot to add flat versions of most of the
			  brick textures.  D'oh! :)

Additional Credits to   : Inspiration came from GothicDM(2), the KZDoom
		          series, Mordeth E2, Requiem, Twice Risen and
			  many other places.
