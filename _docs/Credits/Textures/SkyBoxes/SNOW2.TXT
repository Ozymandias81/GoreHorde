this is set for both software and GL users.

how to use the cursed files: ---------------------------------------------------
------

unzip all this stuff to:

	/Quake2/baseq2/env/

Start Quake 2. Get in the game and open a console with the ~ key and type in:

	sky snow2

get rid of the console and go to a window or go outside (in quake2 that is, not 
for real...)  check out the sky, it should be different.  It isn't?  Uh oh, you 
messed up, 'cause it worked here.  e-mail me...



what you can do with this stuff: -----------------------------------------------
----------

abuse it, lose it, cheat on it, ask for it back, whatever your mind can come up 
with.  All I ask is that if this is used for a TC/PC/Mission Pak/or other form 
of Quake2 thing, let me know and give me a credit line for it.  it would really 
make me happy to see that.  If you use it and make money off it, I'd like a 
shitload of money too.  anyways, i'm pretty cool with this crap, just let me 
know eh?

eat, sleep, drink, quake2.  oh, forget that sleep part.
