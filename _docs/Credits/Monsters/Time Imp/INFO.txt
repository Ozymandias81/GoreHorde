Idea Base: Making a monster that had a bit control over time.

Description:
This Imp, has some control over time.
It has a change to freeze the time for you, while it still can move around, attack with projectiles that still fly.
Any form of time freeze has no effect on this monster, neither the "freeze" command in console or a Time Freeze item.

I updated the monster so now it is able to slow time, in a hacky way, good idea lucario.
I added a friendly version of it, cause if you do summonfriend TimeImp, it will react as a friend first, then when it dies and revives, it will be a enemy.
