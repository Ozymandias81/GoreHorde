Effect: Decals
Type: Blood
Count: 23

To use, place a Decal actor (editor number 9200) next to a wall, and put the
decal's ID (next to the name in the decal's definition) as the first argument.
If they conflict with other decorative decals in your mod, feel free to
renumber them.

Note, these do NOT replace ZDoom's existing blood decals. They are purely map
decoration.
