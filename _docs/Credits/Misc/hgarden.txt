Misc. Author Info       : Makes maps for Doom
Description             : An unreleased GZDoom map I made about a year ago.  It's set in a lush, walled garden
                          in the middle of a desert.  It was supposed to be part of an episode but I don't plan
                          to work on it any more.

                          I would describe the gameplay as arena/slaughter.

                          This map is VERY system intensive.  You will need a fairly modern PC to play this level
                          smoothly.
