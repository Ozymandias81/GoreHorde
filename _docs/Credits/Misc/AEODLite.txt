                          stuff.
                          Features:
                          -Over 40 new weapons, 140 new monsters, all well
                          tested and balanced.
                          -Monsters are faster and smarter, more
                          unpredictable, many of them they also move
                          like players(with acceleration).
                          -Randomized enemy health.
                          -Custom gore that based on other's work, very
                          messy.
                          -Hires sound fx and brightmaps included.
                          -Gain gift points and trade them for random
                          stuff.
