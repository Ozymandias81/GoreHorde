* Requirements *

This PWad will work properly ONLY if you have a fast PC + Doom II + GZDoom.
And for a good PC I mean 2010 or + specifications, due to prevent massive lags
because maps are very big, with stunning quantities of lights & effects.
I have tested this PWad with:
Windows 7 Ultimate x32 with Service Pack 1.0;
GZDoom G1.9pre-406-gad88cfc, downloaded from SVN;
AMD Athlon II x2 250 3ghz;
4gb DDR3 Ram;
nVidia GeForce GT 610 1024mb (2687mb total);
All shaders activated;
Standard light mode, where also Doom or dark mode fits well;
Anisotropic filters OFF;
hq4x scaling mode + all resizing modes ON;
GL Precaching OFF;
A mouse and a PS2 keyboard (I hate wi-fi types!) + a lot of time :-)

...ah, and expect some lags due to engine limitations, there is no way to get'em off...
