Place on map and use the first three arguments to control the intensity and area of the 
spawner.

First argument controls the size of the area. 128, for example, spawns in a 256x256 square ( 
or 256 diameter circle. See third argument).

Second argument controls the frequency of which it spawns snow. The lower the number, the more 
frequent (0 for always).

Third argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is square, 1 is circle.
