Place on map and use the first two arguments to control the intensity and area of the 
spawner.

First argument controls the size of the area. 32, for example, spawns in a 64x64 square (or
64 diameter circle. See second argument).

Second argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is square, 1 is circle.

Third argument controls it's frequency. The lower the number, the heavier the ember count.

Fourth Argument plays the sound. 0 is sound enabled. 1 is sound disabled

Fifth Argument determens if the bubbles are opaque or transparent. 1 for opaque and 0 for Translucent.
Note: The BoilingLavaSpawner has no fifth argument, it is always opaque.
