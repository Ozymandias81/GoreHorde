The first argument controls it's area. 128, for example makes it a 256x256 square or 256-radius
circle (See fourth argument)

The second argument controls it's frequency. The lower the number, the heavier the rainfall

The third argument controls whether or not it plays it's ambient sound. 0 will play the sound,
1 will not

The fourth argument controls the area type. 0 is a square, 1 is a circle
